Replication codes for the "Goh, A.Z.F. 2023. An analysis of Malaysiaâ€™s empirical forward-looking Taylor rule (August 1, 2023)."

All the detailed results are available in the "analysis_full.ipynb" notebook. 
However, please note that the execution of the "analysis_full.ipynb" notebook is restricted due to the sensitive and confidential nature of the inflation expectation series used in the analysis.
On the other hand, you can readily execute the "analysis_inf.ipynb" notebook as it exclusively employs open-sourced data.
